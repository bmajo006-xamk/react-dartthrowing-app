# Darts Scoring App 

An application implemented using React and Prisma technology for tracking scores in a dart-throwing game. 
Players participating in the dart game are added to the app along with upcoming rounds. 
Users input the score after each round, and at the end of the game, the app calculates the results and final scores. 
The homepage of the app displays all previous games and their respective winners.
